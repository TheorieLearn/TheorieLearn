## Welcome to TheorieLearn!

This is a public repository of scaffolding exercises for theoretical computer science, implemented on the on the [PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.org) platform.  These exercises were designed for [CS 374](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs374al1/) and other courses that teach theoretical computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

A public practice course containing all our available exercises is available on [PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.org) to anyone with a Microsoft account, Google account, or login credentials at an university with a PrarieLearn license.

For more information about the TheorieLearn project, including developers, publications, instructor usage, and funding information, please see the project page at <https://theorielearn.github.io/>.

## How to Use Our Resources in Your Own PrairieLearn Course

### Copying Questions

To use a question or series of questions, copy the question folders from our `questions/` into your own `questions/` folder.
Some questions have shared code and resources located in `serverFilesCourse/theorielearn/`. The easiest way would be to place this `theorielearn/` subdirectory into your own `serverFilesCourse`, which will automatically support any question you import from here. You can optionally delete subfolders in `theorielearn/` that aren't imported by the questions you use.

A select few questions have shared resources located in `clientFilesCourse/`. Please check if the questions you use utilize this directory and copy what you need.

### Copying Elements

To use an element, copy the elements you want from `elements/` into your own `elements/` folder. Each element is self contained and should work without external code.

### Automatic Script

TBA! We will provide a script in the future that will let you select questions and elements you want and package it for you to drop in your course, automatically.
