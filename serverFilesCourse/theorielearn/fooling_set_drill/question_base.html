    <hr>
    Consider the language $$L = {{params.non_regular_language}}$$
    A fooling set for $L$ is $$F = {{params.fooling_set}}$$
    We've picked two distinct strings from the fooling set: ${{params.fooling_set_member_1_display}}$ and ${{params.fooling_set_member_2_display}}$.
    Give a distinguishing suffix for these two strings.
    (If your distinguishing suffix is $\varepsilon$, type "e". You may also type "0^{n}" or "1^{n}" to repeat 0 or 1 $n$ times, respectively.)
    <br><br>
    (Note that for a fooling set question on a written homework or exam, you need to be able to distinguish <i>all</i> pairs in your proof.
    To give you some practice on concrete examples, we are only asking you to distinguish specific pairs for this exercise.)
