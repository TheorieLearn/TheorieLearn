<h5>General DP Problem-Solving Advice</h5>
Once we have determined a subproblem definition, we want to create a recursive
definition for this subproblem definition. In order to do so, we should:
<ul>
  <li>
    Consider a choice that we need to make and create exhaustive cases based on
    that choice
  </li>
  <li>
    For each case, figure out an expression representing the "value" of that
    case; this expression will often involve smaller subproblems
  </li>
  <li>
    Figure out how to use the separate cases to evaluate the value of the
    current subproblem
  </li>
</ul>
