                How times is {{externfunc}} called by the above recurrence? <br>

                Enter your answer in terms of T() and O(). <br>
                There should be exactly one big O term in your answer, and it should be the most simplified state. <br>
                There should be at least one (but possibly more) calls to the function T in your answer. <br>
                Enter the first (head) level of the recurrence relation - DO NOT attempt to "unroll" the recurrence relation. <br>
