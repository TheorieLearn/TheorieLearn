To represent a set, input a comma-separated list surrounded by curly braces.
For example, write {a, b, c} for a set containing states a, b, and c.
Note that some input fields below might not require braces.
If your answer is the empty set, please write an empty set "{}" or copy and paste "∅".
Order of elements does not matter.
