Provide a context free grammar that generates the following language:

***<center>{{{params.language_description}}}</center>***

<hr></hr>

##### Instructions

When writing production rules, make sure to include a space between variables (e.g. `S -> A B | C` instead of `S -> AB | C`). In the second version, the grader would interpret `AB` as a single variable.

Also, to handle empty strings, you should just not write anything where you would normally write $\epsilon$. For example, $S \rightarrow \epsilon$ should be written as `S ->`, and $A \rightarrow A0 \mid \epsilon$ should be written as `A -> A '0' |`.

Note that the left-hand side of the first production rule should be the start symbol; The grader doesn't place any special importance on the symbol $S$.

As an example, below are the rules that generate the language 0\*1\*
