<p>For your algorithms class, you have to use an online learning platform called GrassLearn to complete your homework. Your homework consists of $n$ questions, and you have to complete them in order (i.e., you cannot skip a question and go back to it later).</p>

<p>Let $TimeNeeded[1..n]$ be an array of positive integers where $TimeNeeded[i]$ is the number of minutes required to answer Question $i$ correctly. You can assume that you don't spend any time on questions that you answer incorrectly.</p>

<p>Let $Points[1..n]$ be an array of positive numbers where $Points[i]$ is the number of points Question $i$ is worth.</p>

<p>In order to get a grade that you're happy with, you want to earn at least $p$ total points on this assignment. What is the minimum number of minutes you need to spend in order to achieve this goal?</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Consider $TimeNeeded = [20, 10, 5, 100, 2, 1]$, and $Points = [10, 4, 5, 20, 4, 1]$.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If $p = 10$, then answering Questions 3, 5, and 6 correctly will earn $5+4+1 = 10$ points, and this will take $5+2+1=8$ minutes.</li>
    <li>If $p = 20$, then answering Questions 1, 3, 5, and 6 correctly will earn $10+5+4+1=20$ points, and this will take $20+5+2+1=8$ minutes.</li>
</ul>
