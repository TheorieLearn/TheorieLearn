A CS 374 student has fallen behind on course content, and needs to cram for an exam tomorrow! They know
the exam is primarily focused on a certain topic $t$, which they will need to know very well. But in order
to understand topic $t$, they will need to understand the prerequisite content as well. They modeled the
prerequisite structure as a directed graph, where each node represents a topic, and any parents of a given
node are prerequisties, which must be studied before that topic.

The student comes to you, overwhelmed, not sure how to structure their limitted remaining study time. You,
having spaced out your studying and being well-prepared for the exam, instantly notice that their prerequisite
graph is a DAG! You agree to help the student devise a study plan which ensures they are able to study topic $t$
as soon as possible--after all, it's good practice for you too!
