<p>Momo is planning a road trip along a highway with $n$ mile markers, numbered from $1$ through $n$. Momo is currently at mile marker $1$, and she would like to travel to mile marker $n$. However, Momo has a very low attention span and gets exhausted easily, so she can only drive 1 or 2 miles forward on a single day.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is a hotel right next to each mile marker; the costs of these hotels are provided in the array $HotelCosts[1..n]$. If Momo stops at mile $i$ at the end of the day, she will stay overnight in a hotel that costs $HotelCosts[i]$.</p>

<p><b>Determine the minimum possible total cost of all the hotels that Momo stays in during her road trip.</b></p>

<p><i>Note: Momo does not have to stay in a hotel at mile $1$ and mile $n$. Thus, the first and last elements of $HotelCosts$ will always be 0. Also, Momo cannot stay in the same hotel two nights in a row.</i></p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>If $HotelCosts = [0, 1, 374, 3, 0]$, then Momo should start at mile 1, travel to mile 2, stay overnight, then travel to mile 4, stay overnight, and finally travel to mile 5 and complete her road trip. The total cost of this trip would be $1+3=4$.</p>
