<p>You are running a TV station, and need to decide which advertisements to show during an open timeslot of $W$ minutes during a prime-time show.</p>

<p>There are $n$ advertisers, and each advertiser $i$ has their video advertisement and how much they are willing to pay for their ad to be shown. You are given an array $L[1..n]$ and an array $P[1..n]$, where each element $L[i]$ and $P[i]$ are the video length and amount for each advertiser $i$, respectively. Since this is a prime-time slot, the advertisers are also willng to accept a partial showing of their ad—However, if only an $x$ fraction of their advertisement is shown, they are only willing to pay $x \cdot p_i$ dollars.</p>

<p>What advertisements and in what fractions must you show to maximize the revenue earned?</p>
