<p>Suppose you are given a height map of a mountain, in the form of an $n \times n$ grid of evenly
spaced points, each labeled with an elevation value. You can safely hike directly from any
point to any neighbor immediately north, south, east, or west, but only if the elevations of
those two points differ by at most $\Delta$. (The value of $\Delta$ depends on your hiking experience
and your physical condition.)</p>

<p>Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine the longest hike from some point $s$
to some other point $t$, where the hike consists of an uphill climb (where elevations must
increase at each step) followed by a downhill climb (where elevations must decrease at
each step). Your input consists of an array $Elevation[1 .. n, 1 .. n]$ of elevation values, the
starting point $s$, the target point $t$, and the parameter $\Delta$.</p>
