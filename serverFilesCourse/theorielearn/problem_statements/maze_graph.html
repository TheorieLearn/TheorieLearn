You find yourself, along with a team of explorers, inside a mysterious indoor maze.
Legends say there is a teleportation device hidden within that you wish to find.
But beware, maze guardians are said protect the teleportation device, finding intruders and kicking them out.
Being prepared, you bring a map that highlights the maze's pathways,
which indicate where maze guardians have a higher probability of appearing.
You, along with your teammates, carry a charged invisibility device that must be used to traverse these high-risk path segments.
However, the invisibility device's batteries will be depleted after use and must be recharged at charging stations in the maze.
Further, certain walls of the maze contain mysterious hieroglyphics that you and your team want to study.
Finally, the walls of the maze are narrow so to avoid traffic, your team marked path segments as one-way on the map.
<br></br>
You convert your map to an unweighted, directed graph $G=(V, E)$ where $V$ represent intersections in the maze and $E$ represents path segments.
<ul>
    <li> A subset of edges are marked as high-risk. </li>
    <li> A subset of edges are marked as containing hieroglyphics. </li>
    <li> A subset of vertices are marked as charging stations. </li>
    <li> The teleportation device is located at $t$, which is in $V$. </li>
    <li> Your starting position $s$ is also in $V$. </li>
</ul>
Your mission is to find the shortest path (defined by the least number of edges traversed) from $s$ to $t$, traversing at least one edge containing mysterious hieroglyphics.
