<p><em>Problem</em>: Shortest Walk with Intermediate Set Constraint</p>

<p><em>Setup</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Directed Graph ($G$): A directed graph. Edge weights can be assumed to be non-negative.</li>
<li>Source Vertex ($s$): The starting point of the walk.</li>
<li>Target Vertex ($t$): The desired endpoint of the walk.</li>
<li>Required Vertex Set ($X$): A set of vertices within the graph that must be included at least once in the walk.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Goal</em></p>

Determine if there exists a walk from the source vertex $s$ to the target vertex $t$ that includes at least one vertex from the set $X$. If such a walk exists, find the length of the *shortest* possible walk that meets this condition. If no qualifying walk exists, the answer should be infinity.
