<p>You are given a sequence of digits $A[1..n]$ where each digit is between 1 and 9 (inclusive). You are asked to insert $+$ signs in between the digits to partition them into terms which will be added together. The length of each term in the summation must be either 1 or 2 digits. Furthermore, the total number of 2-digit terms in the expression must be at most $t$.</p>
<p>What is the maximum sum that can be achieved under these constraints?</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
Consider $A = 898989$.
<ul>
    <li>If $t = 5$, then the maximum sum that can be achieved is $89+89+89=267$.</li>
    <li>If $t = 2$, then the maximum sum that can be achieved is $8+98+98+9=213$.</li>
</ul>
