<p>You are given a sequence of digits $A[1..n]$ where each digit is between 1 and 9 (inclusive). You are asked to insert $+$ signs in between the digits to partition them into terms which will be added together. The length of each term in the summation must be either 1 or 2 digits.</p>
<p>What is the minimum sum that can be achieved using at most one 1-digit term?</p>
<p>Note: This problem becomes trivial when the number of digits in the sequence is even. </p>




<h4>Example</h4>
If  $A = 19125$, then the minimum sum that can be achieved is $19+12+5=36$.
