<p><em>Note: The question text has been changed slightly from before to reflect that Momo is returning home as well.</em></p>

<p>After her road trip, Momo is ready for an even bigger adventure, a world tour!
There are $n$ cities she would like to visit, which are
numbered from $0$ through $n-1$. These cities are the vertices of an undirected input
graph $G = (V, E)$. The weight on each edge (i.e. the distance between a pair of cities)
is provided through a function $d : V \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ (where
$d(i,j) = \infty$ if there is no edge between $i$ and $j$).</p>

<p>Momo gets bored seeing the same sights twice, so she would like to visit each
city exactly once, starting at $0$ where she lives, and ending back at $0$.
Since she's driving, the cost of the tour is equal to the total
distance traveled. If it is not possible to visit each city exactly once,
your algorithm should return $\infty$.</p>

<p><b>Determine the minimum possible total cost of Momo's tour.</b></p>
