<p>Suppose you are given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, each of whose vertices is either red,
green, or blue. Edges in $G$ do not have weights, and $G$ is not necessarily a dag.</p>

<p>Describe and analyze an algorithm to find a shortest path in $G$ that contains at least
one vertex of each color. (In particular, your algorithm must choose the best start and end
vertices for the path.)</p>
