<p>You are given a sequence of digits $A[1..n]$ where each digit is between 1 and 9 (inclusive). You are asked to insert $+$ signs in between the digits to partition them into terms which will be added together. The length of each term in the summation must be either 1 or 2 digits.</p>
<p>What is the maximum sum that can be achieved under these constraints?</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
If  $A = 1912$, then the maximum sum that can be achieved is $1+91+2=94$.
