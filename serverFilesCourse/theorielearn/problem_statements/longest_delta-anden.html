<p>Consider a sequence $\widehat{\alpha} \equiv \alpha_{1}, . . . , \alpha_{n}$ of $n$ distinct numbers, and a parameter $\delta > 0$. The sequence $\widehat{\alpha}$ is a $\delta$-andén, if there exists an index $i$, such that:</p>

<p>(A) For all $t$, we have $|\alpha_{t} - \alpha_{t+1}| \leq δ$.
    <br> (B) For all $t < i$, we have $\alpha_{t} < \alpha_{t+1}$.
    <br> (C) For all $t \geq i$, we have $\alpha_{t} > \alpha_{t+1}$.
</p>

<p>(I.e., a δ-andén is a hill where the difference between consecutive values is at most δ.)</p>

<p>The input is an array $A[1...n]$, and a parameter $\delta$.
Describe an algorithm that computes the length of the longest subsequence of $A$ that forms a $\delta$-andén.
Your algorithm needs to output the number of elements in this subsequence (and not the subsequence itself).</p>
