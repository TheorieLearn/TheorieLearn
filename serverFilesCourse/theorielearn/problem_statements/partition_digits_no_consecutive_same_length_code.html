<p>You are given a sequence of digits $A[1..n]$ where each digit is between 1 and 9 (inclusive). You are asked to insert $+$ signs in between the digits to partition them into terms which will be added together. The length of each term in the summation must be either 1, 2, or 3 digits. Furthermore, no two consecutive terms in the summation can have the same length.</p>
<p>What is the maximum sum that can be achieved under these constraints?</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
If $A = 9212121921$, then the maximum sum that can be achieved is $921+2+12+1+921=1857$.
<ul>
    <li>Note that $921+212+1+921=2055$ achieves a larger sum, but this is not allowed because there are two consecutive 3-digit terms.</li>
    <li>Similarly, $921+21+21+921=1884$ is not allowed because there are two consecutive 2-digit terms.</li>
    <li>Similarly, $921+21+2+1+921=1866$ is not allowed because there are two consecutive 1-digit terms.</li>
</ul>
