<p>You are given a sequence of digits $A[1..n]$ where each digit is between 1 and 9 (inclusive). You are asked to insert $+$ signs in between the digits to partition them into terms which will be added together. The length of each term in the summation must be either 1 or 2 digits. Furthermore, the total number of 2-digit terms in the expression must be at least $t$.</p>
<p>What is the minimum sum that can be achieved under these constraints?</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
Consider $A = 21199999$.
<ul>
    <li>If $t = 3$, then the minimum sum that can be achieved is $21+19+99+9+9=157$.</li>
</ul>
Note: The greedy solution would have produced a larger sum.
