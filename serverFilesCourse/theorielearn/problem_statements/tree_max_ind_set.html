<p>You've just been appointed as the new organzier of a party at Giggle.

Giggle employees are organized into a strict hierarchy, a tree (where there is a directed edge from a supervisor to their subordinate) with the company president at the root.

The all-knowing oracles in Human Resources have assigned a real number to each employee measuring how "fun" the employee is.
</p>

<br>

There are two <b>restrictions</b> on the guest list:
<ul>
  <li>An employee cannot attend the party if their immediate supervisor is present</li>
  <li>The president of the company must attend the party (it's her company after all)</li>
</ul>

Assume each of the employees are given a label of $1,\ldots,n$ and you have access to array $Fun$ where $Fun[i]$ is the fun that employee $i$ brings to the party
<br><br>
Give an algorithm that makes a guest list for the party that maximizes the sum of the "fun" ratings of the guests.
