Suppose $n$ different currencies are traded in your currency market. You are given a two-dimensional array $R[1 \dots
n, 1 \dots n]$ containing exchange rates between every pair of currencies; for each $i$ and $j$, one unit of currency
$i$ can be traded for $R[i,j]$ units of currency $j$. (Do <i>not</i> assume that $R[i, j] \cdot R[j, i] = 1$.)
<br><br>
Your end goal is to construct an algorithm that returns an array $V[1 \dots n]$, where $V[i]$ is the maximum amount of
currency $i$ that you can obtain by trading, starting with one unit of currency $1$, assuming there are no arbitrage
cycles.
