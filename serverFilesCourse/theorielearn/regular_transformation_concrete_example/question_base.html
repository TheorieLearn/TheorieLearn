Our goal is to show that if $L$ is regular, then $\mathsf{ {{transformation_name}} }(L)$ will also be regular. Since $L$ is regular, we can assume that there exists a DFA $M$ which accepts $L$. In order to show that $\mathsf{ {{transformation_name}} }(L)$ is regular, we will use $M$ to construct {{^M'_is_nfa}}a DFA{{/M'_is_nfa}} {{#M'_is_nfa}}an ***NFA***{{/M'_is_nfa}} $M'$ which accepts $\mathsf{ {{transformation_name}} }(L)$.

In these types of problems, the most important part of the problem-solving process is to *write down English descriptions of what the states in $M'$ mean*. Once we have descriptions of the states' meanings, it is much easier to reason about what the transitions, start state, and accept states should be.

In this GPS, we will provide some scaffolding by giving you these English descriptions. However, don't forget to do this step on your own on homework and exams!

Note that our transformation cannot assume anything about $M$; $M$ can be any arbitrary DFA. However, in order to scaffold the learning process, we will first focus on a concrete example and consider what our transformation does to a *specific* DFA $M$. In the following problems, we will generalize the transformation to an abstract $M$.

Consider the DFA $M$ shown above. If we construct $M' = (Q', \{0,1\}, \delta', s', A')$ from $M$ in accordance with the specification of states above, then what are the components of $M'$?

(Note that we're only asking for a few representative examples of the transition function instead of asking you to fill out the entire transition table for $\delta'$.)

{{#M'_is_nfa}}**Recall that in the definition of an NFA's transition function, the output values are sets.**{{/M'_is_nfa}}
