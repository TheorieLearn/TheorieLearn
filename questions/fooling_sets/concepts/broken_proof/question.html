    Consider the language $L = \{0^{n^{2}} \space | \space n \geq 0\}$. To prove this language is not regular, a student wrote the following proof:
    <div style="margin: 30px; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid black;">
        Let $F = \{0^{n^{2}} \space | \space n \geq 0\}$.
        <br><br>
        Pick two arbitrary strings $x = 0^{i^{2}}$ and $y = 0^{j^{2}}$ from $L$, where $i \neq j$.
        <br><br>
        Then, let $z = 0^{2i + 1}$.
        <br><br>
        We have that $xz = 0^{i^{2} + 2i + 1} = 0^{(i + 1)^{2}} \in L$. On the other hand, $yz = 0^{j^{2} + 2i + 1}$, and
        $j^2 + 2i + 1$ is not a perfect square,
        because we can bound it between two consecutive perfect squares:
        $$j^2 < j^2 + 2i + 1 < j^2 + 2j + 1 = (j + 1)^2.$$
        Thus, $yz = 0^{j^{2} + 2i + 1} \notin L$.
        <br><br>
        To conclude, we have shown that $F$ is a fooling set for $L$. Since $F$ is infinite, $L$ is not regular.
    </div>

    But, there's something wrong with this proof! Given the above definitions of $x$, $y$, and $z$,
    give values of $i$ and $j$ such that $z$ fails to distinguish $x$ and $y$ (i.e. $xz$ and $yz$ are either both accepted or both rejected).

    Which statement from the proof is not necessarily true?

    To fix the proof, we should add which of the following sentences after the second sentence of the proof?
    <pl-multiple-choice answers-name="correction">
        <pl-answer correct="true">Without loss of generality, we can assume that $i < j$.</pl-answer>
        <pl-answer correct="false">Without loss of generality, we can assume that $i = j$.</pl-answer>
        <pl-answer correct="false">Without loss of generality, we can assume that $i > j$.</pl-answer>
