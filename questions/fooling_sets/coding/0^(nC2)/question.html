        The identity $\binom{n}{2} + n = \binom{n+1}{2}$ may be helpful.

    <pl-hint>
        Use the same idea as the $\{0^{n^2} \mid n \ge 0\}$ problem from lab. That solution depended on the identity
        $$n^2 + (2n + 1) = (n + 1)^2.$$
        Try to utilize the identity from the previous hint in a similar way to solve this problem.

    <pl-hint>
        The solution to that lab problem depended on the observation that if $i < j$, then
        $j^2+2i+1$ is not a perfect square, because we can "squeeze" it between two perfect consecutive squares:
        $$j^2 < j^2+2i+1 < (j+1)^2.$$

        For this problem, if you can choose a suffix $z$ such that
        $$\binom{n}{2} < |yz| < \binom{n+1}{2},$$
        then you know for sure that $yz \notin L$.
