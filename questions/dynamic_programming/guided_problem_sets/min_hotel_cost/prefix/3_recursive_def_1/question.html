  Let $MinCost(i)$ denote the minimum possible cost of traveling from mile $1$ to mile $i$, including the
      cost of the hotel at mile $i$.
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Notice that the total cost of Momo's trip can be expressed as:
  <br>
  <br>
  <center>
  <em>[The cost of the hotel at mile $i$] + [The cost of all of the hotels she stayed at before this hotel]</em></center>
  <br/>

  Since we already know the cost of the current hotel, we need to derive an expression for the cost of all of the hotels
  she stayed at before this hotel.
  At this point, we can address the first step of the general problem-solving advice.
  The choice to consider is: what is the last hotel that Momo stayed at prior to staying at the hotel at mile $i$?
  Choose all that apply below.
