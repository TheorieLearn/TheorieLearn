<b>Let's see how this all translates to code!</b>




<p><pl-external-grader-variables params-name="names_for_user" empty="true"></pl-external-grader-variables>
<em>*Note: HotelCosts is now an array, so you must access it with [] rather than ()</em>
</p>

<p>Your code snippet should implement the following function:
<pl-external-grader-variables params-name="names_from_user">
    <pl-variable name="ComputeMinTotalCost" type="function taking in three arguments: a read-only array HotelCosts, the length of HotelCosts n,
        and a memoization array MinCost."></pl-variable>
</pl-external-grader-variables>
</p>

<p>
You MUST write an algorithm according to our definition, or your implementation will not be graded correct (even if you have the correct final answer).
</p>
<p>
<b>Let $MinCost(i)$ denote the minimum possible cost of traveling from mile $1$ to mile $i$, including the
  cost of the hotel at mile $i$.</b>
</p>

<hr/>
<code>HotelCosts</code> and <code>MinCost</code> are not standard Python lists; they are instances of a custom wrapper class that behave like an array. We designed this wrapper class in order to keep track of how your code accesses/modifies the arrays, and we use that information to provide you with better feedback.
Here is some guidance for how to use and modify the memoization array <code>MinCost</code>:
<ul>
  <li>You will first need to set the bounds of <code>MinCost</code> using the <code>set_bounds</code> function, passing in tuples representing the bounds for each dimension. <b>Note that the bounds are inclusive!</b> For example, <code>MinCost.set_bounds((1, 2))</code> will set the memoization array to be 1-D, with accessible elements in the <b>inclusive</b> range [1, 2]. Running <code>MinCost.set_bounds((1, 6), (2, 5))</code> will set the memoization array to be 2-D, where the accessible elements can be called as <code>MinCost[i, j]</code> for the <b>inclusive</b> ranges [1, 6] and [2, 5].</li>
  <li>To access elements in <code>MinCost</code>, you will need to index the array (with comma-seperated values in higher dimensions). For example, if <code>MinCost</code> was set to be 1-D, you can access elements using the syntax <code>MinCost[i]</code>. If <code>MinCost</code> is 2-D, you can access elements with syntax <code>MinCost[i, j]</code></li>
  <li>Your indexing must match the subproblem definition <i>exactly</i>. In particular, that means you need to use 1-indexing in your memoization array, and declare your memoization array to have the same bounds as the domain of the subproblem function.</li>
</ul>
