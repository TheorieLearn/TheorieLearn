  <center><b>Recall that $MaxFun(v, o)$ is the maximum total fun values of a subset of employees chosen from the subtree rooted at $v$ where $o$ represents whether $v$ is included or not.</b></center>
  <br/>
  <p>
    Now, we will address the first step of the above advice. When we are considering $MaxFun(v, o)$, notice that the problem breaks down into the following cases:
    <ol>
      <li>$o = \text{Include}$, so vertex $v$ is included in our subset</li>
      <li>$o = \text{Exclude}$ so vertex $v$ is excluded in our subset</li>
    </ol>

    Let's analyze how our subproblem changes for each of those cases:

<p><b>Case 1:</b> If our solution has $o = \text{Include}$ so that vertex $v$ is included in the subset, what are the options of $o$ for all the children of vertex $v$?
