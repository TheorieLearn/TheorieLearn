  Before starting, please note that this exercise is intended as a challenging
  extension to the course material, and should bring together some important
  concepts. **Other dynamic programming problems in the course will be on
  computationally easier problems that have more efficient runtimes.**
  In particular, the specific type of dynamic
  programming used here is not efficient enough to use on homework or exams.

  #### Example

  Suppose the input graph $G$ to this problem is the following:

  <pl-graph>
  graph G {
    0 -- 1 [label=2]
    0 -- 2 [label=4]
    0 -- 3 [label=3]
    0 -- 4 [label=1]
    1 -- 2 [label=5]
    1 -- 3 [label=10]
    1 -- 4 [label=8]
    2 -- 3 [label=9]
    2 -- 4 [label=7]
    3 -- 4 [label=6]
  }
  </pl-graph>

  The cheapest tour is
  $0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 3$,
  which has total cost $2 + 5 + 7 + 6= 22$.

  To gain some basic understanding of this problem's structure, let's consider
  the simplest (i.e. slowest) algorithm that still produces a correct answer. For
  this problem, that's the algorithm that enumerates every possible tour, computes
  the cost, and returns the tour of cheapest cost at the end. See the pseudocode
  below:

  ```python3
  def WorldTourBruteForce(G):
    minCost = infinity

    for every possible tour T in G starting from 0:
        cost = sum of edge distances in T
        minCost = min(cost, minCost)

    return minCost
  ```

  Remember that every tour has $n-1$ edges.
  What is the (worst case) runtime of this algorithm?
