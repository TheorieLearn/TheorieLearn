After completing the reduction, you mention what you were able to prove to your
friend, Tom Oko. She then exclaims
<br>
<br>
<center>
  <b>"Wait, you wrote a dynamic programming algorithm for Momo's World Tour? Then
  that means you have an efficient algorithm for an NP-hard problem, so you've
  shown that $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$!!"</b>
</center>
<br>
Tom then ran off to tell the professor about this, sure that you would be given
a Turing Award and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems">a million dollars</a>
for all your hard work. You were skeptical of what Tom said,
since the dynamic program you wrote didn't seem as efficient as the others you'd seen in
class.
<br>
<br>
To disprove Tom's statement, let's analyze the runtime of our DP algorithm.
Assume all array accesses take constant time, and give expressions with respect to $n$, the number of cities.
We've reproduced the recursive definition below:
<br>
$$
  \mathsf{WorldTour}(S,i)
  =
  \begin{cases}
    d(i,0) &\text{if } S = \varnothing\\
    \min_{t \in S} d(i,t) + \mathsf{WorldTour}(S-t,t) &\text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
$$
<br>
<em>Note: Multiplication must be expressed as </em><code>a*b</code><em> and
  exponentiation must be expressed as </em><code>a^b</code><em> in the
  symbolic input. Also, recall that your answers must omit constant factors,
  and so in particular, $O(2^{n-c})$ for any constant $c$ must be simplified.</em>

There are 
  <pl-big-o-input answers-name="ans" variable="n" correct-answer="n * 2**n" display='inline' size='7'></pl-big-o-input>
subproblems, and each subproblem takes 
  <pl-big-o-input answers-name="ans2" variable="n" correct-answer="n" display='inline' size='7'></pl-big-o-input>
time to evaluate. The overall runtime is then
  <pl-big-o-input answers-name="ans3" variable="n" correct-answer="n**2 * 2**n" display='inline' size='7'></pl-big-o-input>.

<br>
<br>

Thus, our dynamic program is a(n)

    <pl-answer correct=true>exponential</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct=false>polynomial</pl-answer>
</pl-multiple-choice>
time algorithm for $\mathsf{WorldTour}$, which

    <pl-answer correct=true>does not</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct=false>does</pl-answer>
</pl-multiple-choice>
imply that $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$. However, this
algorithm is still <b><i>much, much</i></b> more efficient than the
naive $O(n!)$ algorithm we discussed earlier!
