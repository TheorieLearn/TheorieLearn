  <center><b>Define $LCS(i, j)$ to be the length of the longest common subsequence between $A[1..i]$ and $B[1..j]$.</b></center>

  Now, we will address the first step of the above advice. When we are considering the $A[1..i]$ and $B[1..j]$, notice that the problem breaks down into the following cases:
  1. Our solution subsequence does not use the character at $A[i]$;
  2. Our solution subsequence does not use the character at $B[j]$;
  3. $A[i] = B[j]$, and our solution subsequence uses that character.

  Let's analyze how our subproblem changes for each of those cases:

<p><b>Choice 1:</b> If our solution character chooses to not use the character at $A[i]$, what are the remaining strings of $A$ and $B$ that we need to consider,
  with respect to our subproblem definition? <i>(Hint: pick two of the following, one for each of A and B)</i>
