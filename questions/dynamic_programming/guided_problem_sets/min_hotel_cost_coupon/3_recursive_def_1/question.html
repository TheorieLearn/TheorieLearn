  <b>Let $MinCost(i, j)$ denote the minimum possible cost of traveling from mile $i$ to mile $n$ (including the
    cost of the hotel at mile $i$) with $j$ remaining coupons.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
  Notice that the total cost of Momo's trip can be expressed as:

  <center>
  <em>[The cost of the hotel at mile $i$] + [The cost of all hotels she will stay at after mile i]</em></center>
</p>
  <p>
  Since we already know the cost of the current hotel, we need to derive an expression for the cost of all of the hotels
  she stayed at after this hotel.
  At this point, we can address the first step of the general problem-solving advice.
  The choice to consider is: what is the next hotel that Momo can stay at after staying at the hotel at mile $i$?
  Choose all that apply below.

  Since we have two parameters in our subproblem, we also need to consider a second choice: Will she use a coupon at this hotel?
  Which of the following is a possible number of coupons that Momo could have remaining for the rest of the trip after staying at hotel $i$?
