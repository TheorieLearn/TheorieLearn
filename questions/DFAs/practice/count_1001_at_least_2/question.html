Assume we have the alphabet $\Sigma = \{1, 0\}$.
Let $\#(x, y)$ denote the number of times the string $x$ appears in string $y$.

Create a DFA in the area below for the following language:

***<center>All strings $w \in \Sigma^*$ for which $\#(1001, w) \geq 2$</center>***

        We recommend you construct a DFA with two main sections, one section finding the first
        occurence of<br> $1001$, the second for finding the second occurence of $1001$.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint show-after-submission=10>
        We recommend a DFA with 9 states. These states would represent: no start of match found,
        $1$ of first $1001$, $10$ of first $1001$, $100$ of first $1001$, first $1001$ found/first $1$ of second
        $1001$, $10$ of second $1001$, $100$ of second $1001$, second $1001$ found, extra $0$ in second $1001$ found.
