Mistakes like the one you just encountered often occur when we don't write down a clear, unambiguous statement about what each of the states in the DFA means. Writing down this description makes it easier for humans to understand and verify the correctness of the DFA.

For example, if you tell me that your DFA transitions from state $d$ to state $h$ after reading a $0$, I have no way to understand what that means or verify that it's correct if I don't know what states $d$ and $h$ mean.

For ease of reference, here is the diagram of the original (incorrect) DFA:

Which of the following are clear, unambiguous statements about what each of the states in the (corrected) DFA means?

    <pl-answer>State 0100 means that we've found 0100, $\epsilon$ means we haven't matched anything yet, and everything else is a match in progress.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer>The current state is the amount that has been matched so far</pl-answer>

    <pl-answer>The current state is the longest suffix of the input read so far that is also a prefix of 0100.</pl-answer>

    <pl-answer>The current state is the longest prefix of 0100 that is also a suffix of the input read so far.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="true">If the current state is 0100, that means we have already read substring 0100. Otherwise, the current state is the longest suffix of the input read so far that is also a prefix of 0100.</pl-answer>
