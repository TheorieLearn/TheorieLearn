For some DFA construction problems, a good first step is to think about how you would write a program to recognize the language. The program should be in the following form:
```
function is_in_language(string):
    initialize variables

    for character in string:
        update variables based on character

    return True or False depending on the final values of the variables
```

How do we decide what variables to declare? Well, it would make sense to store a counter of how many times we've seen the subsequence $01$ in the prefix that we've read so far. That information allows us to determine whether to return True or False when we reach the end of the program.

We need to be able update our counter every time we read a new character (this is the body of the for-loop). In other words, if $w$ is the prefix that we've read so far, we want to know what happens to our counter when we append $0$ or $1$ to $w$. This question focuses on how to perform that update.

Assume that we know $\sigma(01, w) = 7$.

*Hint: consider the strings $01111111$ and $00000001$. What happens when we append 1 to these two strings?*
