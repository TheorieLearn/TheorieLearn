**You must correctly solve this problem multiple times to receive full credit.**

In this problem, we define $\sigma(z, w)$ to be the number of times $z$ appears as a *subsequence* in $w$.
(Note that this is **not** the same as $\#(z, w)$, which is the number of times
$z$ appears as a substring in $w$.) For example, $\sigma(01, 0101) = 3$.

Consider the following language: $L = \{w \mid \sigma(01, w) \equiv 4 \pmod 7\}$.

The goal of this series of questions is to guide you through *one possible approach* for designing a DFA that accepts this language.

First, we'll start off with some concrete examples to make sure that we're on the same page.
