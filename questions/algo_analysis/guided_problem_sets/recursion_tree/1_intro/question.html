    Throughout this problem set, there are several questions which ask for Big O runtime bounds.
    Recall that Big O notation ignores constant factors (which includes bases of logarithms).

  <p>
    <b>All questions which require giving an answer in Big O notation must be simplified (omit constant factors) to be graded properly.</b>
    For example, $O(cn) \rightarrow O(n)$ and $O(\log_3 n) \rightarrow O(\log n)$.
