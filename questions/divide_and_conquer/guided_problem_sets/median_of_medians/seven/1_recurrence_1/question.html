If you are unfamiliar with <code>MomSelect5</code>, refresh yourself by reading the textbook
<a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs374/sp2021/notes/01-recursion.pdf#page=17">here</a>. It is important that you understand
the reasoning behind this algorithm before attempting these questions.
We will be analyzing a slight variation on this algorithm: <code>MomSelect7</code> We will see how choosing different
intervals for the median selection can lead to different runtimes.

Let's create a runtime recurrence for this algorithm. The recurrence consists of a $T(\cdot)$ term for each recursive call and a big-$O$ term for
all of the work done outside of those recursive calls.

What is the big-$O$ term with respect to $n$, the number of elements in $A$?
Assume that `MedianOfSeven` runs in constant time due to a constant input size, and `Partition` run in linear time with respect to input size.
Please simplify your answer, i.e., $O(cn) \rightarrow O(n)$.

The work done at this step of the algorithm is $O\Big($
