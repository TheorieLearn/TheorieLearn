        Use the same idea as the "delete 1" problem from lab, but modify the solution to
        insert an arbitrary number of 1s rather than a single 1.

    <pl-hint>
        Let $Q' = Q \times \{\mathit{inserting1s}, \mathit{after}\}$.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint>
        In the $\mathit{inserting1s}$ states, use epsilon transitions to simulate the effect
        of $M$ reading the deleted 1s. In the $\mathit{after}$ states, just read the input string normally.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint>
        When you're at state $(q, \mathit{inserting1s})$,
        you can either ask $M$ to simulate reading another deleted 1,
        or you can decide that you're done simulating the $1^n$ prefix and start reading the input string $w$.
        Use non-determinism to account for both of these possibilities.
