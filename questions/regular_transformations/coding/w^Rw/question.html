        Use the same idea as $\{w \mid ww^R \in L\}$. However, this time, the two simulations should
        start in the same state. This is the state where $w^R$ "passes the baton" to $w$. One of the
        simulations should end up in the initial state, and the other simulation should end up in an
        accepting state.
