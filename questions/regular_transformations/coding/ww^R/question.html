        Make sure you understand the solution to "reverse" before attempting this problem.
        Simulate reading $w$ on $M$ and reading $w^R$ on $\mathit{reverse}(M)$.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint>
        Your states should be of the form $(q_i, q_j)$, where $q_i$ is the current state of the
        simulation of $M$ and $q_j$ is the current state of the simulation of $\mathit{reverse}(M)$.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint>
        The two simulations need to end up in the same state. This is the state where $w$ "passes the
        baton" to $w^R$.
