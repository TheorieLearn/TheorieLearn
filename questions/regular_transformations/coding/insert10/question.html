        Use the same idea as the "insert 1" problem from lab. However, after we
        nondeterministically choose to ignore a 1, the next symbol must be a 0, and we
        also have to ignore that. (If the next symbol is not a 0, that means we guessed
        incorrectly when we chose to ignore the 1.)

        Let $Q' = Q \times \{\mathit{before}, \mathit{between1and0}, \mathit{after}\}$.
