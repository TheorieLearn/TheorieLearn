For regular language transformation problems, a good first step is to think
about what additional information you need to record about the input string as
it's being read. This will inform how to construct an NFA or DFA corresponding
to the language transformation.

Consider the language transformation from before:

$\mathsf{SWAP}(L) := \{\mathsf{swap}(w) \mid w \in L \}$, where $\mathsf{swap}(w)$
is defined recursively as

$$
  \mathsf{swap}(w) = \begin{cases}
    w &\text{if } |w| \leq 1\\
    ba \bullet \mathsf{swap}(x) &\text{if } w = ab \bullet x \text{ for some } a, b \in \Sigma \text{ and } x \in \Sigma^*
  \end{cases}
$$

We are designing a DFA $M'$ which accepts $\mathsf{SWAP}(L)$. Since $L$ is
regular, we can assume there is some DFA $M$ which decides it.

It's clear from the description of the problem that we need to know whether the
index of a character we've read in is even or odd. In this question, we'll be
asking about what additional information is needed for a DFA to decide the language.

<p>If we've just read in a character $a$ which we know has an even index (starting from 1) in $w$, what other information do we need to determine how to transition in the DFA we're designing?</p>
