For regular language transformation problems, it's important that you fully
understand the transformation in question. A good first step is to think about
a very simple language and consider what strings are accepted by the transformed language.

Consider the following language transformation:

$$\mathsf{INSERT01}(L) := \{ x01y \mid xy \in L \}$$

Suppose that $L = \{ 10 \}$. What strings are contained in $\mathsf{INSERT01}(L)$?
