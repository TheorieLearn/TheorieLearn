For regular language transformation problems, a good first step is to think
about what additional information you need to record about the input string as
it's being read. This will inform how to construct an NFA or DFA corresponding
to the language transformation.

Consider the language transformation from before:

$$\mathsf{INSERT01}(L) := \{ x01y \mid xy \in L \}$$

We are designing a NFA $M'$ which accepts $\mathsf{insert01}(L)$. Since $L$ is
regular, we can assume there is some NFA $M$ which decides it.

We clearly need to record any prefix of a possible inserted $01$ we've seen so far.
In this question, we'll be
asking about what additional information is needed for a NFA to decide the language.
