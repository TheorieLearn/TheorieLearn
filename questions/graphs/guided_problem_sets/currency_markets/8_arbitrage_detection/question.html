    <h3>Detecting Arbitrage Cycles</h3>
    In the past several questions, we assumed there were no arbitrage cycles, which are a series of trades that would
    allow us to start with one unit of currency $i$ and result with more than one unit of currency $i$, making infinite
    profit possible.

    Let's say we are running our algorithm without this assumption. What could we do to determine if there were
    arbitrage cycles in the graph we construct?
