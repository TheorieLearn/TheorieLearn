    <h3>Determining our Vertices</h3>
    Before we start developing a graph algorithm to solve our problem, we need to create a graph that represents our
    input data, which is $R[1 \dots n, 1 \dots n]$. First, we'll consider the vertices of such a graph.
    <br>
    <br>
    Which of the following should our vertices reasonably coorespond to?

<pl-multiple-choice answers-name="q1" hide-letter-keys="true">
    <pl-answer feedback="Correct! For further problems, we will assume vertex $v_i$ cooresponds to currency $i$ for all $i$." correct="true">The individual currencies</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer feedback="Our problem consists of turning something into something else. At each step, are we turning pairs of currencies into different pairs of currencies?">All possible ordered pairs of currencies</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer feedback="Our problem consists of turning something into something else. At each step, are we turning pairs of currencies into different pairs of currencies?">All possible unordered pairs of currencies</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer feedback="Our graph will eventually contain this information, but not as the vertices.">The exchange rates</pl-answer>
