### Problem: Shortest Walk with Intermediate Set Constraint

#### Setup

* Directed Graph ($G$): A directed graph. Edge weights can be assumed to be non-negative.
* Source Vertex ($s$): The starting point of the walk.
* Target Vertex ($t$): The desired endpoint of the walk.
* Required Vertex Set ($X$): A set of vertices within the graph that must be included at least once in the walk.

#### Goal

Determine if there exists a walk from the source vertex $s$ to the target vertex $t$ that includes at least one vertex from the set $X$. If such a walk exists, find the length of the *shortest* possible walk that meets this condition. If no qualifying walk exists, the answer should be infinity.

##### Example
In the graph below, if $s=2$, $t=4$, and $X=\{3,1\}$, then your algorithm should output $1+3+4+2=10$.

<pl-graph>
    digraph G {
      2 -> 0 [label=1]
      0 -> 3 [label=3]
      3 -> 0 [label=4]
      0 -> 4 [label=2]
      2 -> 1 [label=812]
      1 -> 4 [label=374]
    }
</pl-graph>

We will consider a new approach to solve this problem instead of graph layering.

Let's break down how we might solve this problem:

* **Splitting the Problem**
Can we divide this challenge into smaller, easier pieces? What if we focus on these two parts separately:
1. Finding the shortest path from $s$ to any vertex in $X$.
2. Finding the shortest path from any vertex in $X$ to $t$.

Think about how we would do this.

For finding the shortest path from $s$ to any vertex in $X$ most efficiently, we can:

Finding shortest path from all vertices in $X$ to $t$ is the same as finding shortest path from $t$ to all vertices in $X$ in the reverse graph G.rev().
