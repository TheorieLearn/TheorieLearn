  For example, the following graph displays dependencies between some topics in CS 374.

  <pl-graph>digraph "Example" {"DFA/NFAs" -> "Graphs"; "Induction" -> "Div & Conquer"; "Div & Conquer" -> "DP"; "DP" -> "Graphs"}</pl-graph>

  A valid study plan would be $\textbf{[Induction, Div&Conquer, DP, DFAs/NFAs, Graphs]}$, but <em>not</em> $\textbf{ [Induction, Div&Conquer, DP, Graphs, DFAs/NFAs]}$,
  since the student would study graphs before learning about DFAs/NFAs, which is a prerequisite.

  <h3>Initial Approaches</h3>
  The student has the first instinct to use the DAG shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path to topic $T$.
  Will this approach guarantee a valid study plan?

  This approach will always work because the student can study a topic only if they have satisfied all prereqs
  This approach will not always work because the student can study a topic without having satisfied all prereqs
  This approach will not always work because the student cannot study a topic unless they have satisfied any
  This approach will never work because the student cannot study a topic if they have satisfied all prereqs
