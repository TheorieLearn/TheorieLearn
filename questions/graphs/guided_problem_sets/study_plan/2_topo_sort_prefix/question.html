  <h3>Study Plan Properties</h3>

  ...so it's not as simple as just using DAG longest path.

  Let's explore some examples and see what we can deduce about
  the properties of a valid study plan. For now, we will ignore the weights of the nodes, and only worry about creating valid
  study plans (rather than optimal ones).


  Use the following graph to answer the questions. Let $t$ (the "target" node) be $6$.

Is $0, 1, 3, 6, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 5$ a valid topological sort?
  <pl-multiple-choice answers-name="ts1" weight="1">
    <pl-answer correct="false">Yes, because every node is listed before any of its children.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="true">No, because it lists a node before it lists all of its ancestors.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">No, because it does not list <em>all</em> the source nodes first.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">Yes, because it starts at a source and ends at a sink.</pl-answer>

  Write a topological sort of the graph, <em>which is different from those in the above questions</em>. Your answer should be written as a list of
  ten integers (e.g., <code>2740153968</code>, for the above example), corresponding to the vertex labels in the DAG.

  <h4>Noticing Patterns</h4>

  Suppose we have a (new) prerequisite graph with the following topological sort: $A, F, P, E, C, L, S, D, Q, O, R$.
  Which of the following (if any) are <em>guaranteed</em> to be valid study plans for $t = L$?

  <br>

  <pl-multiple-choice answers-name="prefix" weight="2">
    <pl-answer correct="false">$R, O, Q, D, S, L$</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="true"> $A, F, P, E, C, L$</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">$A, F, P, E, C, S, D, Q, O, R, L$</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">$L$</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">Not enough information</pl-answer>
  </pl-multiple-choice>

  <pl-hidden-hints>
    <pl-hint show-after-submission="1">
      Recall that a topological sort must list a parent node before any of its children. How does this relate to a study plan?
