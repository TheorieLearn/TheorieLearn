  We've seen that a topological sort gives us a valid order to study topics in. But we often end up with
  unnecessary topics in our study plan! Given the time-sensitivity of this task, we need a way to ensure
  we are only studying topics that are <em>absolutely necessary</em> to study before topic $t$. Complete the
  sentence below to construct the strongest claim possible about a valid study plan.
