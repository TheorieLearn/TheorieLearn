While we move around $G$, we need to keep track of our current vertex, and we also need to keep track of one additional piece of information in order to ensure that our walk obeys the rules of a French Flag Walk.
Which of the following pieces of information could we keep track of to ensure that our walk is a valid French Flag Walk?
