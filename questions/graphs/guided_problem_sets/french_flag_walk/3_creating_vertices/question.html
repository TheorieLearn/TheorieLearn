In the last question, we determined what values we could track.

**We will proceed by tracking the number of edges traversed so far, modulo 3**

We *could* modify our reachability algorithm to store one of these values as perform our search. However, algorithm modifications can be tricky and introduce lots of edge cases.
Instead, we will proceed with a different approach: we will encode this information into a new graph, and run a standard reachability algorithm on this new graph.

We will define a new graph $G' = (V', E')$. Using the idea that we want to track *the number of edges traversed so far modulo 3*, what should our new set of vertices $V'$ be?
