  <h3>Constructing G'</h3>
  To make the newly constructed graph more clear, we will recreate the problem statement with a small example.
  Start state: $s$, high-risk paths: $\{s\to t\}$, hierogylphic edges: $\{t\to s\}$, goal: $t$, recharge stations:
  $\{a\}$. In the diagram below,
  "R" represents high-risk and "H" represents hieroglyphics.
  <pl-graph>
    {{{params.original_graph}}}
  </pl-graph>
  From this, we generate our new graph $G' = (V', E')$. Recall from the previous part that $V' = V \times H \times C$.
  Now, we need to define the transitions to complete our graph construction. After entering the rules for $E'$ and
  clicking the submit button,
  a new $G'$ will be generated based on your given rules. Keep in mind some rules may not affect this example graph
  but should nonetheless be written to generalize to other graphs.
  <br></br>
  To write the rules, specify a start vertex to an end vertex. The arrow direction "$\to$" indicates the direction of
  the edge.
  Each vertex such as (u, NotSeen, Full) is specified by three components, each coming from sets $V$, $H$, and $C$, just
  as you defined before.
  To represent an element from:

  <ul>
    <li>$V$: Write "u" to represent any outgoing vertex from $G$ and "v" to any matching incoming vertex from $G$.</li>
    <li>$H$: Write "NS" to represent "NotSeen" and "S" to represent "Seen". Write "h" to represent a generic element of
      $H$ (i.e., by using "h", you are saying that the specified edge should be added for both $h =$ Seen and $h =$
      NotSeen).</li>
    <li>$C$: Write "F" to represent "Full" and "E" to represent "Empty. Write "c" to represent a generic element in $C$
      (i.s., by using "c", you are saying that the specified edge should be added for both $c =$ Full and $c =$ Empty.
    </li>
  </ul>
