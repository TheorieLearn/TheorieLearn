In the last question, we determined what values we could track. We found that tracking "the previous two colors traversed" was correct.
Indeed, we could solve the question using this information. However, for the remainder of this problem set we will track the following information:

**The longest suffix of colors traversed that is a prefix of [White, Blue, Red].**

This allows us to keep track of what color sequence we just traversed that would contribute to the color pattern of the Russian flag.
So, if the last color traversed does not contribute to the Russian flag color pattern, we do not need to keep track of the last color. Otherwise,
we keep track of the last colors traversed that match the color pattern.

We *could* modify our reachability algorithm to store one of these values and perform our search. However, algorithm modifications can be tricky and introduce lots of edge cases.
Instead, we will proceed with a different approach: we will encode this information into a new graph, and run a standard reachability algorithm on this new graph.

We will define a new, directed graph $G' = (V', E')$.
Using the idea that we want to track *the longest suffix of colors traversed that is a prefix of [White, Blue, Red]*, what should our new set of vertices $V'$ be?

    <li>Make sure to write both the braces, and elements seperated by commas.</li>
    <li>The order of elements does not matter</li>
    <li>"None" represents no colors seen that contribute to the pattern of the Russian flag.</li>
    <li>"W" represents white, "R" represents red, "B" represents blue.</li>
    <li>Chain color symbols together to represent the ordered colors just traversed.
        For example "WRR" represents the last three edge traversed were white, red, and red just before reaching the current vertex.
        Another example is "W", which represents having just traversed a white edge.</li>
