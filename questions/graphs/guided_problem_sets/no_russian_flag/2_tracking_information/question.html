While we move around $G$, we need to keep track of our current vertex, and we also need to keep track of one additional piece of information in order to ensure that our walk obeys the rules of a No Russian Flag Walk.
Which of the following pieces of information could we keep track of to ensure that our walk is a valid No Russian Flag Walk?

    <pl-answer score="0.5" feedback="This option is technically viable, but it contains extraneous information which is not needed to ensure the validity of our walk, and keeping track of this extraneous information will slow down our algorithm.
