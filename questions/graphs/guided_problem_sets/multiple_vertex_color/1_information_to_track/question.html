  <h3>Information to Track</h3>
  First, we must determine what information needs to be kept track about past decisions in traversing the graph to inform future decisions.
  Please select the options below that would be <b>necessary</b> to keep track of to help solve the problem:

<pl-checkbox answers-name="q1" weight="1" fixed-order="true">
  <pl-answer feedback="Knowing the precise number of vertices traversed is unecessary.">
    The number of vertices you have traversed per color.</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer correct="true">If you have traversed a vertex for each color: red, green, or blue.</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer feedback="Knowing a global number of vertices is not required since you only need to keep track of local vertices you encountered.">
    The total number of vertices per color in the graph.</pl-answer>
</pl-checkbox>
