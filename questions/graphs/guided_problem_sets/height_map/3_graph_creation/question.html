  <h3>Constructing G'</h3>
  To make the newly constructed graph more clear, we will recreate the problem statement with a small example.
  The start state is $[1.1]$. Below is a graph $G$ representing the given height map. The edge weights represent the
  elevation change in meters when going from one vertex to another. $\Delta = 25$.
  <pl-graph>
    {{{params.original_graph}}}
  </pl-graph>
  From this, we generate our new graph $G' = (V', E')$. Recall from the previous part that $V' = R \times C \times D$.
  To be compatible with the backend generation code, we modify the vertex definition for this part only to be $RC \times D$ where
  $RC$ is the set containing $[n.m]$ for all $n \in R$ and $m \in C$. In other words, we combine $R$ and $C$ so that $[n.m]$ represents
  the $n^{th}$ row and the $m^{th}$ column of the height map. Note: $Elev[i, j]$ represents the $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ index of the $Elevation$ map.

  To write the rules, specify a start vertex to an end vertex. The arrow direction "$\to$" indicates the direction of
  the edge. Each vertex such as ([1.1], up) is specified by three components, each coming from sets $RC$ and $D$.
  To represent an element from:

  <ul>
    <li>$RC$: Write "[i.j]" to represent any outgoing vertex from $G$ and "[i'.j']" to any matching incoming vertex from $G$.</li>
    <li>$D$: Write "up" and "down" to represent the uphill and downhill portions of the climb. Write "d" to represent a generic element of
      $D$ (i.e., by using "d", you are saying that the specified edge should be added for both $d =$ up and $h =$
      down).</li>
  </ul>
