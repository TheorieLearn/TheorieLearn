<pl-checkbox answers-name="q1" weight="1">
    <pl-answer correct="true" feedback="This is important information that changes the state you are in.">
      Whether you are in the uphill or downhill phase of your climb.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="true" feedback="This is relevant in deciding where you can next move since you can only move to adjacent positions.">
      Which position you are in the $Elevation$ map, which is the given 2D array.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer feedback="Knowing the number of positions travelled will not help solve the problem.">
      The number of positions you have traversed in the $Elevation$ map, which is the given 2D array.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer feedback="The global height is not necessary since only the difference between successive heights is relevant here.">
      The total vertical height you have traversed.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer feedback="Your peak height does not help in allowing you to decide where you can next move.">
      Your peak elevation so far.</pl-answer>
