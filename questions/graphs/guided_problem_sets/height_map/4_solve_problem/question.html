    <h3>Using G' to Solve the Problem</h3>
    Next, we need to use our constructed graph $G'$ to solve our problem. Let "si" and "sj" be the starting
    row and column of the height map where you begin your climb. Let "ti" and "tj" be the ending row and column
    of the height map where you end your climb. Please format your answers in the form "(a, b, c)", where "a", "b", "c" come from
    your vertex definition. Note that there should be a space after each comma. You may find it useful to reread the problem statement
    to figure out which state to start and end in.

Specifically, we need to find the longest path from the starting vertex:
<pl-string-input answers-name="q1" correct-answer="(si, sj, up)" size="10" show-help-text="false"></pl-string-input>
to the ending vertex:
<pl-string-input answers-name="q2" correct-answer="(ti, tj, down)" size="10" show-help-text="false"></pl-string-input>
in $G'$.
Because $G'$ is a dag, we can solve the problem in the most efficient way using
<pl-multiple-choice answers-name="q3" display="dropdown" hide-letter-keys="true">
    <pl-answer>Bellman Ford's Algorithm</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer>Dijkstra's Algorithm</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer>Kosaraju-Sharir's Algorithm</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="true">Depth-First Search</pl-answer>
</pl-multiple-choice>
on $G'$.
