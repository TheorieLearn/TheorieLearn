    For example, consider the following graph:

        <pl-graph>
        digraph G {
            s -> 1 [label=1]
            s -> 2 [label=1]
            1 -> t [label=10]
            2 -> 1 [label=2]
        }
        </pl-graph>

        The alternating length of $s \to 1 \to t$ have alternating length of $1 - 10 = -9$, while
        the alternating length of $s \to 2 \to 1 \to t$ have alternating length of $1 - 2 + 10 = 9$.
        <b>Notice that a specific edge (such as $1 \to t$) can have different coefficients depending
    on its position in different paths!</b>

    <h3>Information to Track</h3>
    We'll solve this problem by transforming $G$ and running a known algorithm on the new graph.
    Intuitively, what specific concept from class is most appropriate to apply for solving this problem?

    To construct a new graph, we must determine what information needs to be kept track about past decisions in traversing the graph to inform future decisions.
    In addition to the current vertex we're on, which pieces of information would be <b>necessary</b> to track in solving the problem:
