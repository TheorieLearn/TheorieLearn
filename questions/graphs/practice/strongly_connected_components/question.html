Consider the following following graph $G$.

Recall that two vertices $u$ and $v$ in a graph $G$ are strongly connected if $u$ can reach $v$ and $v$ can reach $u$.
The strong component graph, also referred to as a meta-graph or condensation of $G$, is a directed acyclic graph obtained from $G$ by contracting each strong component to a single vertex and collapsing parallel edges.

In this question, we will exercise identifying strong components and applying a topological sort to the resulting meta-graph.

**What are the vertices of the meta-graph?**
- Enter your answer as a comma separated list where each item of the list corresponds to the vertices in the meta-graph of $G$.
- *Example:* `01324, 5678, 9`

**What are the edges of the meta-graph?**
- Enter your answer as a list of edges from vertex $u_i$ to vertex $v_i$ as $u_i \rightarrow v_i$
- *Example:* `01324 -> 5678, 01324 -> 9`

**What is the topological sort of the meta-graph?**
- Enter your answer as a comma separated list where each item of the list corresponds to the vertices in the meta-graph of $G$, in topological order.
- *Example:* `01324, 5678, 9`
