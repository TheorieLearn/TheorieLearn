  Consider the following DAG $G$.
</p>
<p>
  <pl-graph engine='circo'>
      {{params.img}}
  </pl-graph>
</p>
<p>
  Recall that a topological sort of $G$ is a list of all its vertices
  such that if $(u,v) \in E(G)$ then $u$ appears before $v$ in the
  list. Write down a topological sort of the DAG above.
  Your answer should be written as a list of nine integers
  (e.g., <code>123456789</code>), corresponding
  to the vertex labels in the DAG.
