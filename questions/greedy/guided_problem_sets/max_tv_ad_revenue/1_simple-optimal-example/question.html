Consider the following question:
<pl-template file-name="theorielearn/templates/problem-statement.mustache">
    <pl-variable name="is-open">True</pl-variable>
    <pl-variable
      name="problem-statement"
      directory="serverFilesCourse"
      file-name="theorielearn/problem_statements/max_tv_ad_revenue.html"
    ></pl-variable>
</pl-template>

<p>To get a better idea of the problem, let's look at a simple example:</p>

<p>Suppose that there are $n = 4$ advertisers with $L = [1, 5, 8, 2]$ and $P = [10, 20, 40, 5]$. Suppose that the total time available is $W = 5$ minutes. What is the maximum revenue you can obtain?</p>

<p>Provide your answer in the form of an array $X[1..n]$, where each element $X[i]$ represents the time (in minutes) of the advertisement from the $i$-th advertiser. For example, $[0, 0, 0, 2]$ would indicate that you would only play the fourth advertiser's video for two minutes.</p>
