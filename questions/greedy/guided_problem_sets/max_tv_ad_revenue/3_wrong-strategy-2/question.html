<p>Our previous approach fails because we have only considered the prices each advertiser pays, ignoring the length of each advertisement. As a result, we might fail to look at possible time slot distributions with advertisers with short-length ads. Considering this, let's take a look at another possible greedy strategy:</p>

<p><i>“Sort the advertisers in increasing order with respect to the length of their advertisements, and distribute the time slot in this order.”</i></p>

<p>For example, if n = 4, W = 5, L = [5, 3, 1, 1], and P = [40, 30, 10, 10], we would give the time slot to the last three advertises in full and receive a revenue of 30 + 10 + 10 = 50, which is the maximum amount for this set of advertisers. <b>Again, can you think of a counterexample where this strategy fails to find the maximum?</b></p>

<p>Provide your answer in the form of the problem parameters $n$, $W$, $L[1..n]$, and $P[1..n]$. Also provide an array $X_{W}[1..n]$, where each element $X[i]$ represents the time (in minutes) allocated to the advertisement from the $i$-th advertiser with the strategy described in this problem, and an array $X_{C}[1..n]$ which represents the optimal solution.</p>
