<p>A possible approach to solving this problem is to use a greedy strategy. Because we want to maximize our revenue, it may be reasonable to prioritize advertisers that are willing to pay the most amount. As a result, consider the following strategy:</p>

<p><i>“Sort the advertisers in decreasing order with respect to the amount they are willing to pay. Distribute the time slot in this order.”</i></p>

<p>For example, if n = 3, W = 5, L = [1, 2, 5], and P = [5, 10, 40], our strategy would indicate that we should allocate the entire amount of time to the third advertiser, receiving a revenue of 40, which is the maximum amount for this set of advertisers. <b>Can you think of a counterexample where this strategy breaks down?</b></p>

<p>Provide your answer in the form of the problem parameters $n$, $W$, $L[1..n]$, and $P[1..n]$. Also provide an array $X_{W}[1..n]$, where each element $X[i]$ represents the time (in minutes) allocated to the advertisement from the $i$-th advertiser with the strategy described in this problem, and an array $X_{C}[1..n]$ which represents the optimal solution.</p>
