We have the following strategy:
<br><br>
<i>"Sort the advertisers in decreasing order with respect to the value $P[i]/L[i]$, and distribute the time slot in this order.</i>
<br><br>
How can we show this is the optimal strategy? We can use an inductive exchange argument to construct a proof for the correctness of this algorithm.

Using the given blocks below, construct a proof for the correctness of this algorithm. Assume you are given the number of advertisers $n$, the time slot duration $W$, and the arrays $P[1..n]$ and $L[1..n]$.
