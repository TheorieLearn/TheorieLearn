***Create a regular expression for the language of all strings not containing 010.***

---

It's often helpful to view regular expressions from the perspective of blocks (introduced earlier in the GPS). In particular, conditions that prohibit a specific substring can often be rephrased as a constraint on the blocks in the string.

Write a statement describing the constraints on the blocks that are allowed to appear in strings belonging to the language above.
