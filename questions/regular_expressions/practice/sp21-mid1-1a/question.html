Assume we have the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$.

Provide a regular expression for the following language:

$$\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid w \textbf{ does not have the substring } 111\}$$

As an example, the string $11001$ is in the language, but $111101$ is not.

        We cannot have more than two $1$s appear without immediarely following a $0$ or the end of the string.
