Assume we have the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$.

Provide a regular expression for the following language:

$$\{w \in \Sigma^* \mid \textbf{ all } 0 \text{ blocks of } w \text{ are of even length } \}$$

Recall a $0$ block is a maximal non-empty substring of 0's in the string.
As an example, the string $0000100$ is in the language, but $001110$ is not.

        If you never add just 0, and only ever add 00 then, then any run of zeroes would be even.
