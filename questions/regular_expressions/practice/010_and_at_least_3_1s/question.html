Provide a regular expression for the following language:

***<center>All binary strings containing $010$ and containing at
  least three $1$s.</center>***

<hr>
</markdown>

</pl-question-panel>

<tl-regex-input answers-name="q1">
a = (0+1)*
a 010 a 1 a 1 a  +  a 1 a 010 a 1 a  + a 1 a 1 a 010 a
</tl-regex-input>

  <pl-hint show-after-submission=2>
    There must be two more $1$s in addition to the $1$
    that appears in $010$. Do casework on where those two $1$s appear
    relative to the $010$ substring.
  </pl-hint>
  <pl-hint show-after-submission=4>
    There should be three cases. The final answer should be the union of
    three regular expressions, one for each case.
  </pl-hint>
  <pl-hint show-after-submission=6>
    The two $1$s can both appear before $010$, both
    after, or one before and one after.
