Assume we have the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$.

Provide a regular expression for the following language:

***<center>All strings of length at least $5$ such that the symbols at positions divisible by $5$ are all $0$'s.</center>***

As an example, the string $1001 \underline{0} 1111 \underline{0} 0101 \underline{0} 11$ is in the language as all of the underlined symbols are $0$'s.

    zat = (0+1)(0+1)(0+1)(0+1)0

        Break it into steps. How can you get every string of length divisible by $5$ with a $0$ at the right spot?
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint show-after-submission=6>
        If you have a regex for all acceptable strings of length divisible by $5$, you just need another for all strings
        of length less than $5$.
