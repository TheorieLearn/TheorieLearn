Assume we have the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1, 2\}$.

Provide a regular expression for the following language:

***<center>The set of all strings in $\Sigma^*$ that do not contain at least one of the symbols in the alphabet</center>***

As an example, the strings $00110, 2112, 0022, 00$ are in the language, but $0121$ is not.
