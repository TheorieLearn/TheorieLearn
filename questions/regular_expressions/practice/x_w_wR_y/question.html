Assume we have the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$.

Provide a regular expression for the following language:

***<center>$\{ x w w^R y \mid w, x, y \in \Sigma^+ \}$</center>***

        Lets work backwards, say you have some string from the language, say $z$. So $z = x w w^R y$
        for nonempty $x, w, y$. Since $w$ is not empty we know $w = pa$ for some character $a$ and
        string $p$. So $w^R = a p^R$. Therefore $z = x p a a p^R y$, which contains the substring $aa$.
        Moreover, $xp$ and $p^R y$ each have at least one symbol and can be anything. Find a way to
        put any value $aa$ could be between any combination of characters and you have a string in
        the language.
