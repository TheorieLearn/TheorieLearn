Assume we have the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$.

Provide a regular expression for the following language:

***<center>All strings $x \in \Sigma^*$ such that $x$ does not begin with $101$ and $\#_0(x)$ is divisible by $3$.</center>***

    z = 01*
    startz = 0(1*(z)(z)0)*1*(z)(z)
    startoo = 11(1*(z)(z)0)*1*

    (startz)+(startoo)+(startzoo)+(extra)

        Consider all the different cases where the string does not start with $101$. Can you solve each of them
        individually?

    <pl-hint show-after-submission=6>
        Union together the following cases:

        - Strings that start with $0$ in the language
        - Strings that start with $11$ in the language
        - Strings that start with $100$ in the language
        - Strings of length less that $3$ in the language
