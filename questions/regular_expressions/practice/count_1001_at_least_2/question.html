Assume we have the alphabet $\Sigma = \{1, 0\}$.
Let $\#(x, y)$ denote the number of times the string $x$ appears in string $y$.

Provide a regular expression for the following language:

***<center>All strings $w \in \Sigma^*$ for which $\#(1001, w) \geq 2$</center>***

any = (1+0)*
disjoint = any (1001) any (1001) any

disjoint + overlap

      You should separately handle the case where the two 1001 strings overlap and the case were the two
      strings of 1001 are disjoint.
