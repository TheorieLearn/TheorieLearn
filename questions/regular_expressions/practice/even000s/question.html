    For what values of $n$ does the substring $000$ appear in $0^n$ an odd
    number of times?
  </pl-hint>
  <pl-hint show-after-submission=4>
    Consider the maximal blocks of 0s that appear in a string. For example,
    in $10001101110000100000$, the maximal blocks of $0$s are
    $$1(000)11(0)111(0000)1(00000).$$
    Then, consider the number of occurrences of $000$ contributed by each block.
  </pl-hint>
  <pl-hint show-after-submission=6>
    Some of these blocks contribute an odd number of occurrences of $000$.
    We want those types of blocks to appear an even number of times.
