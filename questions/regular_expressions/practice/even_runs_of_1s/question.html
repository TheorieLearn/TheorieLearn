Assume we have the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$.

Provide a regular expression for the following language:

***<center>All strings in $\Sigma^*$ in which every run of $1$s is even in length.</center>***

For example:

* `110011` is in the language.
* `101` is **not** in the language.

        Treat each block of 1's as a group of pairs `11`. Make sure to consider where `0`s can appear.
