Assume we have the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1, 2\}$.

Provide a regular expression for the following language:

***<center>All strings in $\Sigma^*$ that have at least four $0$'s and exactly two $1$'s.</center>***

        You might want to generate this one programmatically instead of doing it by hand.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint show-after-submission=3>
        Consider all of the different numbers of $0$'s that you could have before the first 1.

    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint show-after-submission=6>
        Remember that $2$ is in the alphabet. Since there are no restrictions on it you should make sure that any amount

        of them can be at any point in a valid string.
