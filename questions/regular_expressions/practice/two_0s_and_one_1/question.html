<tl-regex-input answers-name="q1">
  A = (0+1)*
  A 01*01*0*1 A + A 11*01*0 A + A 00*11*0 A
</tl-regex-input>

<pl-hidden-hints>
  <pl-hint show-after-submission=2>
    Do casework on where the first $1$ appears relative to the first two $0$s.
  </pl-hint>
  <pl-hint show-after-submission=4>

    regular expressions, one for each case.
