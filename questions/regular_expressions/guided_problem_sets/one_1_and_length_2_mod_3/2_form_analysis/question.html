***Create a regular expression for the language of all binary strings $w$ such that $|w|\bmod 3 = 2$ and $w$ contains exactly one 1.***

The goal of this series of questions is to guide you through *one possible approach* to solving this problem. This is not the only approach, and we are not trying to suggest that it is the best approach.

---

Notice that strings in this language are of the form $0^x$ $1$ $0^y$. Adhering to the definition of the language, what must be true of $x$ and $y$?

*Grading note: If the answer is "4 mod 7", we will not accept equivalent answers such as "11 mod 7".
