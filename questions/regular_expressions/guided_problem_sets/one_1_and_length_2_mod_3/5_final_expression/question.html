***Create a regular expression for the language of all binary strings $w$ such that $|w|\bmod 3 = 2$ and $w$ contains exactly one 1.***

The goal of this series of questions is to guide you through *one possible approach* to solving this problem. This is not the only approach, and we are not trying to suggest that it is the best approach.

---

Using the regular expressions you built in the previous part as cases, build a regular expression that describes this language.

*Hint: What operation do you use for language union?
