***Create a regular expression for the language of all strings except 000.***

The goal of this series of questions is to guide you through *one possible approach* to solving this problem.
This is not the only approach, and we are not trying to suggest that it is the best approach.
Our sole intent is to introduce one possible way of building regular expressions.

---

Every regular expression you construct should have two qualities:

1. It should be correct. To get a perfect score, your regular expression must match every string in the language, and nothing else.
2. It should be understandable. That means it should be written in a way such that a human or a computer could verify its correctness in a reasonable amount of time. Readability is just as important as correctness.

Your regular expression does *not* have to be "elegant", nor do you have to optimize the number of characters you're using.
When writing algorithms, you may have been told that you should strive to achieve lower time bounds.
For regular expressions, there is no such equivalent -- your aim should be to communicate your ideas as clearly as possible.

Thus, in this problem, we will construct a regular expression that is not necessarily concise, but is correct and understandable.

Before starting to construct our expression, we should begin with a couple of key observations:

This language only excludes the string 000, which has length
<pl-integer-input answers-name="1.1" display="inline" show-help-text="false" size="4" correct-answer="3"></pl-integer-input>.
<br>
That means the language accepts:
<ul>
    <li>
        <pl-multiple-choice answers-name="1.2" display="dropdown" hide-letter-keys="true">
            <pl-answer correct="true">all</pl-answer>
            <pl-answer>some</pl-answer>
            <pl-answer>no</pl-answer>
        </pl-multiple-choice>
    string(s) with length strictly less than 3,</li>
    <li>
        <pl-multiple-choice answers-name="1.3" display="dropdown" hide-letter-keys="true">
            <pl-answer>all</pl-answer>
            <pl-answer correct="true">some</pl-answer>
            <pl-answer>no</pl-answer>
        </pl-multiple-choice>
        string(s) with length 3, and
    </li>
    <li>
        <pl-multiple-choice answers-name="1.4" display="dropdown" hide-letter-keys="true">
            <pl-answer correct="true">all</pl-answer>
            <pl-answer>some</pl-answer>
            <pl-answer>no</pl-answer>
        </pl-multiple-choice>
        string(s) with length strictly greater than 3.
    </li>
</ul>
