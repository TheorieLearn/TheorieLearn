We now have a regular expression for:
- every string in the language with length less than 3
- every string in the language with length equal to 3
- every string in the language with length greater than 3.
We can combine these expressions to create the final expression for our language, as every string in the language falls into one of the above categories.
Using the expressions from the previous three questions, construct a regular expression for the language containing every string except for 000.
