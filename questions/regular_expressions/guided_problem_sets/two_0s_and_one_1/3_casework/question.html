The goal of this series of questions is to guide you through *one possible approach* to solving this problem. This is not the only approach, and we are not trying to suggest that it is the best approach.

---

Following our observation, what are the possible subsequences with exactly two 0s and exactly one 1?

For this question, write your answer as a comma-separated list of possible subsequences.
