***Create a regular expression for the language of all binary strings containing at least two 0s and at least one 1.***

The goal of this series of questions is to guide you through *one possible approach* to solving this problem. This is not the only approach, and we are not trying to suggest that it is the best approach.

Before starting to construct our expression, we should begin with a key observation about this language:

A string is in this language if and only if it contains a
<pl-multiple-choice answers-name="p1" display="dropdown" hide-letter-keys="true">
  <pl-answer correct="true">subsequence</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer>substring</pl-answer>
</pl-multiple-choice>
with
<pl-multiple-choice answers-name="p2" display="dropdown" hide-letter-keys="true">
  <pl-answer correct="true">exactly</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer>greater than</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer>less than</pl-answer>
</pl-multiple-choice>
two 0s and
<pl-multiple-choice answers-name="p3" display="dropdown" hide-letter-keys="true">
  <pl-answer correct="true">exactly</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer>greater than</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer>less than</pl-answer>
</pl-multiple-choice>
one 1.

Note: A *subsequence* is sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. This is different from a *substring*, which is a **contiguous** subsequence. For example, 111 is a subsequence of 10101, but it is not a substring. 010 is both a subsequence and substring of 10101.
