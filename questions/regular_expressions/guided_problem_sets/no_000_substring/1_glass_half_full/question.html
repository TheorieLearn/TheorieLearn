***Create a regular expression for the language of all strings not containing 000.***

The goal of this series of questions is to guide you through *one possible approach* to solving this problem. This is not the only approach, and we are not trying to suggest that it is the best approach.

It's often helpful to view regular expressions from the perspective of blocks (introduced in the previous problem). In particular, "not containg substring" conditions can often be rephrased as a constraint on the blocks in the string. What are the constraints on the blocks in strings not containing 000?
