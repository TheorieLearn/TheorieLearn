Now, we want to use the subexpression from the previous problem as a building block to construct the complete regular expression.

Your friend claims that we can just apply a Kleene star to the subexpression to obtain our final answer. With this method, your friend obtains the regular expression $((0+00)11^*)^*$. This is on the right track! However, it neglects to handle a few edge cases.

Provide a counterexample where your friend's regular expression fails.
